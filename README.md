# fake-news-detector
A fake news detector using neural networks with keras.

## Concept Used
For the neural network I choose to use a Embedding layer and a LSTM layer:
* Embedding: a word embedding is a class of approaches for representing words and documents using a dense vector representation.
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):  is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture capable of learning long-term dependencies.

## Conclusion
Using this kind of neural network I achieved an accuracy more than 99%, so that we can distinguish with enough certainty a fake news from a real news.
